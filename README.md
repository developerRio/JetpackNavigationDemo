# JetpackNavigationDemo
The project sample shows JETPACK Architecture Component i:e; Naviagtion.  Made with ‚ù§ in kotlin.

# What's the Need for this Naviagtion ?
The Question arises, when already we had activities & intents for the naviagtion between different pages then why do we need this !
Basically in opening one activity at a time is fine with android, but when we start navigating from activity to activity so just because of various call backs & Interfaces the entire process consumes more RAM as well as more battery,
So after encountring this issue, Jetpack's navigation comes which uses just a single activity, a Host Fragment is added which ill be created when activity is created.
Hence it's just the process of Fragment to Fragment navigation process, & decreases power & memory consumption upto 68% which is Huge.

# Future Upgrades of this Repo:
1. will be adding Transitions during fragment to fragment change.
2. How to open a fragment from a Recycler Adapter.


Happy Coding !
